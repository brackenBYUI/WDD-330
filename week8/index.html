    <h1>Week 8 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h2>
    <p>The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page<br>
        Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative;<br>
        The translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top<br>
        If you only want to move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey functions respectively.<br>
        The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. For example, scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them.<br>
        As with translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. These functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions respectively.<br>
        The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value.<br>
        The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes.<br>
        You can control the origin from which your transforms are applied. This is done using the transform-origin property.<br>
        The transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default.

    <h2>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h2>
    <p>
        With HTML5â€™s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript.<br>
        Unlike canvas, images created with SVG are available via the DOM.<br>
        Drag and Drop API allows us to specify that certain elements are draggable, and then specify what should happen when these draggable elements are dragged over or dropped onto other elements on the page.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How are would it be to create a canvas without using the api?</li>
    </ol>
