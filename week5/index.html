    <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h2>
    <p>There are 3 ways errors can occur</p>
    <ul>
        <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</li>
        <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.</li>
        <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>User errors are in fact also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that prevents the user from making the error.<br>
        An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.<br>
        A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence.<br>
        A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash.<br>
        When a runtime error occurs in the browser, the HTML will still appear, but the JavaScript code will stop working in the background.<br>
        If a warning occurs, the JavaScript will continue to run (although possibly incorrectly).<br>
        Strict mode produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features.<br>
        Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file: <b>'use strict';</b><br>
        You can even use strict mode on a per-function basis by adding the line inside a function.<br>
        Linting tools are also useful for enforcing a programming style guide.<br>
        It's possible to add a linting tool as a text-editor plugin; this will then highlight any sloppy code as you type. Another option is to use an online linting tool that allows you to simply paste onto a page for feedback. Another option is to install linting software on your computer using npm. This can then be run as part of your workflow.<br>
        Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more consistent and less likely to have problems.<br>
        Browsers will support certain features and others won’t. You can’t always rely on users having the most up-to-date browser, either.<br>
        <b>Modernizr</b> is a library that offers an easy way to implement feature detection and <b>Can I Use?</b> is another useful resource for checking which features are currently supported in different browsers.<br>
        Most modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set <b>breakpoints</b> in your code that will pause it at certain points. You can then see the values of all the variables at those points and modify them.<br>
        One of the most useful commands is the <b>debugger</b> keyword. This will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and allow you to see where the program is currently up to.<br>
        It is possible to handle exceptions gracefully by catching the error. Any errors can be hidden from users, but still identified.<br>
        Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Do most companies use a TDD framework like Jest?</li>
        <li>Wouldn't it be better to write the code then write the tests?</li>
    </ol>
