    <h1>Week 10 Notes</h1>
    <h2>MDN: Validating forms</h2>
    <p>
        When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application.<br>
        Different types of client-side validation: Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features, JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript.

        <a href="./formValidation/js-validating.html">Java Script Validation</a>
    </p>
    <h2>MDN: Using Fetch</h2>
    <p>
        The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses.<br>
        Fetch requests are controlled by the connect-src directive of Content Security Policy rather than the directive of the resources it's retrieving.<br>
        The fetch() method can optionally accept a second parameter, an init object that allows you to control a number of different settings<br>
        A fetch() promise will reject with a TypeError when a network error is encountered or CORS is misconfigured on the server-side<br>
        Instead of passing a path to the resource you want to request into the fetch() call, you can create a request object using the Request() constructor, and pass that in as a fetch() method argument<br>
        The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor. A headers object is a simple multi-map of names to values<br>

    </p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Would you want to use both Java script and built in validation on most applications?</li>
        <li>I have always used fetch to get a json object how often would you use fetch to get other object like a text object or image?</li>
    </ol>
