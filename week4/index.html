    <p>A module is a self-contained piece of code that provides functions and methods that can then be used in other files and by other modules.<br>
        This will help reduce duplicated code and key code separated.<br>
        Small single-purpose modules enable developers to use only the modules that are needed. To help reduce the size of the application.

    <h3>ES6 module points</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.</li>
        <li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
        <li>The value of <b>this</b> in the top level of a module is <b>undefined</b>, rather than the global object.</li>
        <li>You can't use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn't very common in any JavaScript program these days).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ES6 module files is just a normal JavaScript file, but you use the keyword <b>export</b> to specify any values or functions that are to be made available from the module.<br>
        <b>Default exports</b> refer to a single variable, function or class in a module that can be imported without having to be explicitly named.<br>
