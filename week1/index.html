    <p>At work we program larger to smaller I really liked the quote by Joel Marsh "If you design for the smallest, 
        least powerful device first, then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality. 
        That leads to simple, beautiful apps." <br>If we have to change our minds now for the new viewing devices that means
        we will continue to change our minds because new viewing devices are being released all the time. <br>
        Mobile devices are changed out way more ofter than desktops. Desktops replaced every 4-5 years. Mobile devices replaced every ~2 years.<br>
        Phones are more widely available to more people. Most home have a phone for each person but same home will share the same desktop<br>
        Downsides to mobile first. Time consuming and costly for a full rebuild.<br>
        Make things as easy as possible for users. When having a user complete a task make it as few of steps as possible.<br>
        Make your page as efficiency as possible. Speed matters don't make users wait.</p>
        <h4>Optimize Site/App</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce image usage throughout sites/apps</li>
            <li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
            <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Move most commonly used items to the bottom of the page. Think about having the main nav to the bottom of the page.<br>
        Think about removing the Hamburger menu button and just use Menu with a boarder.<br>
        Remove labels on Forms for mobile devices will make it look a lot better.<br>
        Also use float labels so you know what the field is after filling in information on the form<br>
        Enable auto complete on forms to help users fill out form quicker and with less errors.<br>
        Try using an single line input field for credit card info.<br>
        Make sure to use the correct keyboard for the input<br>
        Don't use pop up adds ever.<br>
        Make adds small and simple. Should not take 40% or more of window.<br>
        Have adds reveal something when the user clicks on them.<br>

    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How do you decide on what view size to start with?</li>
        <li>How do you know what increments of media queries to use?</li>
        <li>Is there any limitation on changes you can make to your site from the norm that other sites have set? Like the Hamburger button and the location of the main nav.</li>
    </ol>
