    <h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Reading Notes</h2>
    <p>Best practice to write each statement on a new line and terminate by a semi-colon.<br>
        There are large list of Reserved words that can not be used when naming variables.<br>
        There are six primitive data type: String, <b>Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined, Null</b>. Everything else is an object.<br>
        JavaScript has a special operator called <b>typeof</b> for finding out the type of a value.<br>
        Any variable declared outside of a block is global scope. It is not best practice to have global scope variables.<br>
        If <b>let</b> or <b>const</b> are not use than the variable will have a global scope.<br>
        You can use the <b>length</b> property to find how many items are in an array.<br>
        The join method is used to merge all items in an array into a string. a variable can be added like & that will be input between each variable.<br>
        Sets  is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values, so it cannot include any duplicate values.<br>
        Sets offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have been duplicated.<br>
        Maps are a convenient way of keeping a list of key and value pairs.<br>
        Ternary Operator is a shorthand way of writing an if else statement.</p>
        <h4>Arrow Functions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>They are much less verbose than normal function declarations.</li>
            <li>Single parameters don't need putting into parentheses</li>
            <li>The body of the function doesn't need placing inside a block if it's only one line</li>
            <li>The <b>return</b> keyword isn't required if the return statement is the only statement in the body of the function</li>
            <li>They don't bind their own value of <b>this</b> to the function</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>I assume each company will have their own Code structure that they will want you to follow?</li>
        <li>Will each company have a different structure for naming of variable?</li>
        <li>How often would you use Bitwise?</li>
        <li>What are scenarios where you would use Soft Equality vs Hard Equality?</li>
        <li>Are Ternary Operators used more often than if else statements?</li>
    </ol>
